# Week 3 - Introduction to the tidyverse

## Description and Topics

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages that share a similar design philosophy. These tools allow for complex data transformations that aid in the EDA process. Topics covered will include:

-   Data transformation using the `dplyr` package
-   Common functions for data transformation (`select`, `filter`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarize`)
-   Piping functions using `magrittr`
-   Creating reproducible examples for troubleshooting (`reprex`)
